Python XY on Ubuntu & Derivates
===============================

**Pythonxy-linux** is the linux side of `Pythonxy for Windows <https://python-xy.github.io/>`_ , a free scientific and engineering development software for numerical computations, data analysis and data visualization based on `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language, `Qt <http://www.trolltech.com/>`_ graphical user interfaces and `Spyder <http://spyderlib.googlecode.com/>`_ interactive scientific development environment. 

The Ubuntu-based distributions were chosen first, due to

* its wide installation base
* the available infrastructure

Other distributions are welcome to join.

The objectives of Pythonxy-linux are to

1. provide up-to date versions of the most commonly used packages

   a. Many packages develop faster than the Ubuntu/Linuxmint release cycles
   b. Packages in the distribution's repositories are quickly outdated
   c. Solution: import to Launchpad and re-package into a PPA once the upstream source changes.

2. Add new packages to the repositories

   a. the stack of Scipy/Pydata packages grows at fast pace
   b. so within a short time new libraries are added to the basic toolset of the scientific programmer
   c. Solution: import upstream code and create new packages

3. replicate the successful 1-stop-shop experience established by Pythonxy for Windows

   a. Quick download and install the needed packages for scientifc programming
   b. Solution: creation of suitable meta-packages [future]


Outlook
===========

The priorities are reflected in the above mentioned objectives. No further outlook can be given because these goals already pose a high workload.
